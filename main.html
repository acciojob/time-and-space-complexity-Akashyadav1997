	<h1>Time, Space, and Complexity </h1>
	<p>Time complexity measures how the runtime of an algorithm grows with input size, and an efficient algorithm is one with the lowest possible time complexity for the problem.</p>
    <p><b>Space complexity</b> is the amount of memory an algorithm uses as input size grows, and yes, it can be expressed in Big-O notation like O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(nÂ²), etc., depending on the extra space required.</p>
